Sample Text File for Hash Testing
-----------------------------------
This is a simple file you can use to test hashing.
You can read this file in Python and compute hashes,
such as using hashlib.sha256() or the built-in hash().

Modify the content and observe how the
hash value changes with even tiny edits.
